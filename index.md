Hi there!

Previously, this website was used for ECE 4960 Fast Robots, but now it is this >:).

Professionally, I am a senior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell with a minor in Robotics. I do research in Prof. Napp's lab, where I work on a robot that can build structures out of stones and bean bags. I am also currently a TA for Fast Robots, and I have previously been a TA for MAE 2250 Mechanical Synthesis.

Hobbies-wise, I have too many, but I love skiing, snowboarding, hiking, sewing, indoor rock climbing, and occasionally sometimes practicing business penmanship and american ornamental penmanship.
