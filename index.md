<h1>Lemon / L.M. Nawrocki ECE 4960</h1>
<p>Hi there! </p>
<p>I'm L.M. Nawrocki, and I also go by Lemon. Usually, I go by Lemon out loud and by L.M. Nawrocki in various written forms of communication, with the execption of email, where Lemon is great. Feel free to ask me about my name; it's a bit of an experiment I designed myself. </p>
<p>My pronouns are they/them.</p>
<p> I'm a junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell. I might minor in Robotics.</p>
<p> Outside of school stuff, I'm loosely vegan (actually pescatarian) and I love studying American Ornamental Penmanship.</p>
<p> Looking forward to this class :) </p>
