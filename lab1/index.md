# some blog-style meandering and rambling:

building a website is kind of hard for a meche major who is relatively unfamiliar with github, has never used markdown before, and gets overwhelmed easily by lots of pages and advice on how to do it.

I'm pretty happy with the simple stuff I ended up with, but it took slightly more than meets the eye for me to get here.

Some web-design notes:
Make new pages with a folder in the main repository folder (where the first index.md is stored). Then put new index.md files in the folder. The link to the page will be <main website>/<folder name>.
