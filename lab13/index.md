# Lab 13

*coming soon...*
## The plan: heck localization
as you may have noticed my lab 12 report was moderately unhinged and the localization was approximately as good as throwing a dart at the map.

therefore, shockingly, i will not be doing any localization in this lab, since I think the act of spinning to localize and localizing wrong would cause me to lose any sense of where my robot is more than actually helping it go on its path.

luckily, i still have two TOF sensors, which is good enough for doing some wall following shenanigans.
