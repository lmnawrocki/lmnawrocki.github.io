# Lab 3 Sensors

# Why You should use shutdown pins
using shutdown pins will make it more clear in my code which TOF sensor the code is "talking" to at any point in time.

I am not the best at CS and thus it is good to know very clearly what is happening.

Also, I'm too lazy to think of a new address for the second TOF sensor, and this is a great way to avoid that.

(There's no way that's better than the other, really. Both ways work. Except my way is obviously better.)

# some soldering stuff I learned
Soldering is very hard. The wires in this project are made up of a bunch of smaller wires. 
1. after stripping a wire, twist the end together to make it stronger
2. put a little bit of solder on the twisted wire. You don't need enough to make the wire noticibly
