# Lab 5
## Pre-Lab:

Circuit diagram:

The Artemis and the motors should be powered seperately because the motors use WAY more current than the Artemis. I would probably (almost definitely) fry the Artemis if I tried to connect them to the same connection. Or I would have a VERY slow robot.

I will be using pins 6,7,12, and 13 for motor control on the Artemis.

I intend to measure out how long wires need to be by situating them over the car before I begin any soldering.

## Procedure
 1. 
 The reasonable settings for the power supply might be putting in 3V (same as battery power) and starting out 

 2.
